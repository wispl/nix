# mithrix (Shortened to mix cause it is too long)
# Basically a minimal nix manager which collects all my nix related scripts.
# Most of them will be "aliases" to normal nix commands, but cooler (I wish).
# 
# Risk of Rain 2 spoiler ahead !!! Bet you did not expect this in a script.
# For those rare but precious Risk of Rain 2 fans out there, Mithrix is the
# final boss, whose nickname is the King of Nothing. Coincidentally, nix
# also means nothing, so Mithrix is the King of Nix, so I think they are
# thrustworthy enough for my nix-related activities.
