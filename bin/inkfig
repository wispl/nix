# Helper script to help insert and draw inkscape figures based off
# https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-2/
#
# Run inkfig path/to/figure to create a svg of the drawing. Saving via Ctrl + S
# automatically exports the svg as a pdf and tex file in the same directory.
#
# This requires inotifywait.
#
# When creating or editing a figure (distinction does not matter), we
# 	1. start a watcher to export pdf on save
# 	2. create a file if it does not exists or opens it
# 	3. when we finish and close inkscape, the watcher is killed
#
# NOTE: the watcher is started and killed automatically so there is no need to
# manually start and stop it.

# Watches for svg changes using inotifywait
#
# Upon updates to the svg, re-export the pdf using inkscape
